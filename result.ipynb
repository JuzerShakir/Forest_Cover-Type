    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A short description I want to give of how I am going to solve this project before starting. Our goal in this project is to classify which forest type it is from the data given.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This study area includes 4 Wilderness Areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado. These area represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological process rather than forest management practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each observation is 30m x 30m forest cover type determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from the data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have been given a total of 54 attributes/features, (excluding 1 target variable) these attributes contain Binary and Quantative attributes, and I need to predict which Forest Cover-Type is it from the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I will first explore the data, visualize it, know what the data wants to tell us. Remove any missing values and features that have null values and scale the data within a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the data 75%-25%, train-test set respectively. Will use 10 K-fold Cross Validation on train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feed the training data to the Naive Bayes (Our Benchmark Model) and evaluate the result on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training will be done on the Solution Models that I have chose, those are:-\n",
    "    - K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), \n",
    "    - Random Forest (RF) and \n",
    "    - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    All these models will be boosted with Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting) boosting algorithm since we have uneven number of observation of classes in the target varaible.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Scores will be evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choosing the best model from above based on metrics scores and testing that model on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Info regarding the how I am going approach the problem and data summary is given in `proposal.pdf` file. [Visit](https://github.com/JuzerShakir/Forest_Cover-Type/blob/master/proposal.pdf)"
